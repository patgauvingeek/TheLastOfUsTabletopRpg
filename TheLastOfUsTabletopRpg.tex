\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ccp{150mm}}
    \rpgitem{} & Alteration & Used by field medic to heal wounds or to change runners into personnal servant to carry things
                              like in The Walking Dead. \\ 
    \rpgitem{} & Creation & used to craft survival items or to create traps \\  
    \rpgitem{} & Energy & used to represent the ability to use a flamethrower or other energy weapon or device. At GM discretion,
                          your character may have access to an illimitted amount of fuel. So missing fuel would be part of the
                          story, not something that happens because the character overused the flamethrower. \\
    \rpgitem{} & Entropy & used to manipulate the infected so they will attack other humans that stand in the way. Choosing this
                           attribute means your character knows how to manipulate the infected using bottles and bricks. \\
    \rpgitem{} & Influence & used like entropy to control the infected, but can also be used to control other human beings through
                             hallucinogenic gas that your character is the only one to know the recipe. It can be an effective trick
                             the character has to interogate someone, like Joel does when he's looking for Ellie. \\
    \rpgitem{} & Movement & used if your fast \\
    \rpgitem{} & Prescience & used to represent a calculative mind able to predict things before they happends. \\
    \rpgitem{} & Protection & used to reprensent the ability to attract attention of the infected to create an invisible barrier or
                              shielding others so they can catch their breath.
